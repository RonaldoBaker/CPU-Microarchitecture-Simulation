# CPU-Microarchitecture-Simulation

## Overview
This program simulates the central processing unit (CPU) microarchitecture shown below. This design and simulation was an assignment a part of the Digital Design module in Electronic & Electrical Engineering at UCL. By using SystemVerilog hardware design language, the main code and testbench code were written to simply simulate a computer counting to five, incrementing up by one on the positive clock edge.
